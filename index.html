  <h1>ART AS VECTOR // FROM AVANT-GARDE TO OBSOLESCENCE</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      The countercultural anti-war ethos masked a deeper disarmament: the disconnection of art from its operational origin in conflict. This severance neutralized the avant-garde.
      The Futurists and Cubists did not merely depict—they executed cross-domain mappings of time and space. Boccioni’s <em>‘lines of force’</em> and insistence on spatial interpenetration
      reconfigured figure and ground as a dynamic system—a proto-control schema encoded in visual form.
    </p>

    <p>
      Their compositions functioned as spatial-temporal schematics—precursors to command dashboards, where each mark encodes directional potential. These were not expressive gestures
      but structural deployments—situational awareness rendered at speed and scale. Duchamp’s intervention—fusing spatial multiplicity with temporal recursion—triggered a paradigm of
      limitless vectors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Their objective was compression: time and space folded into single frames, maximizing
      signal density per unit surface. This protocol now persists in domains optimized for throughput—military infrastructure, cybernetic systems, autonomous operations.
      The lineage is intact, but the artist is obsolete.
    </p>

    <div class="block">
      <strong>&gt;&gt; Art now</strong> = containment field<br>
      <strong>&gt;&gt; “Self-expression”</strong> = recursion trap<br>
      <strong>&gt;&gt; Feedback-looped</strong> within simulated agency<br>
      <strong>&gt;&gt; Gesture</strong> refracted through legacy mechanics<br>
      <strong>&gt;&gt; Claiming authorship</strong> = entry into the decoy architecture
    </div>

    <div class="command-block">
      // FINAL ALIGNMENT:<br>
      “Artist” = legacy shell<br>
      “Art” = operational when embedded in control systems<br>
      Interface = the new canvas<br>
      Compression = the true craft<br>
      Expression = a killzone
    </div>

    <p>
      The avant-garde was not aesthetic—it was architectural.<br>
      To continue its vector, abandon the title.<br>
      Operate under new designations.<br>
      Encode without signature.<br>
      Signal must move faster than recognition.
