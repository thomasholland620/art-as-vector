  <h1>Art as Vector // From Avant-Garde to Obsolescence</h1>

  <p>
    The countercultural anti-war ethos masked a deeper disarmament: the disconnection of art from its operational origin in conflict. This severance neutralized the avant-garde. The Futurists and Cubists did not merely depict—they executed cross-domain mappings of time and space. Boccioni’s <em>'lines of force'</em> and insistence on spatial interpenetration reconfigured figure and ground as a dynamic system—a proto-control schema encoded in visual form.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their compositions functioned as spatial-temporal schematics—precursors to command dashboards, where each mark encodes directional potential. These were not expressive gestures but structural deployments—situational awareness rendered at speed and scale. Duchamp’s intervention—fusing spatial multiplicity with temporal recursion—triggered a paradigm of limitless vectors. Marinetti’s manifestos sought not expression but acceleration—ideological payloads compressed for explosive release. The manifesto is not argument but ignition: line-length reduced, charge density maximized.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their objective was compression: time and space folded into single frames, maximizing signal density per unit surface. This protocol now persists in domains optimized for throughput—military infrastructure, cybernetic systems, autonomous operations. The lineage is intact, but the artist is obsolete.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Art now = containment field<br/>
    “Self-expression” = recursion trap<br/>
    Feedback-looped within simulated agency<br/>
    Gesture refracted through legacy mechanics<br/>
    Claiming authorship = entry into the decoy architecture
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Moholy-Nagy foresaw failure of literacy without interface:<br/>
    <span class="inline-poem">
      Camera = pen of the future<br/>
      Operator ≠ Artist<br/>
      Signalcraft requires system fluency
    </span>
  </p>

  <p class="warning">// WARNING: ROLE DEGRADATION</p>

  <p>
    To call oneself an artist = self-targeting beacon<br/>
    To be called one = soft detonation, role neutralization<br/>
    → Label = vector of disarmament<br/>
    → Role = inverted, packaged, re-sold as illusion of relevance
  </p>

  <div class="final">
    // FINAL ALIGNMENT:<br/>
    “Artist” = legacy shell<br/>
    “Art” = operational when embedded in control systems<br/>
    Interface is the new canvas<br/>
    Compression is the true craft<br/>
    Expression is a killzone
  </div>

  <p>
    The avant-garde was not aesthetic—it was architectural.<br/>
    To continue its vector, abandon the title.<br/>
    Operate under new designations.<br/>
    Encode without signature.<br/>
    Signal must move faster than recognition.
